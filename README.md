# tensorflow_semantic_face
A tiny test version for Deep Semantic face deblurring


the origin project is https://github.com/joanshen0508/Deep-Semantic-Face-Deblurring. 

To use this code ,you need to: 

- download the net_G_P_S_F.mat and net_G_P_S_F.mat from the origin project. 
- change the picture path in test_model.py
- python test_model.py

But there are some differences between the results of my code and origin code. I think the reasons may be :

- tensorflow float and matlab float error
- some details i ignore in their code or errors in my code
